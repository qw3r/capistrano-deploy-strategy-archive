    module Strategy

      # This class implements a strategy for deployments with prebuilt
      # packages. It copies the package to each target host and uncompresses
      # it to the release directory. You'll need to set :archive_file to the target archive.
      #
      #   set :deploy_via, :archive
      #   set :archive_file, "target/#{application}.tar.gz"
      #
      # This strategy is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the :copy
      # strategy, and supports all the same configuration variables EXCEPT
      # those that deal with creating the package. For example,
      # :build_script and :copy_exclude are not supported.
      #
      # This deployment strategy also supports a special variable,
      # :copy_compression, which must be one of :gzip, :bz2, or
      # :zip, and which specifies how the package should be decompressed on
      # each host.
